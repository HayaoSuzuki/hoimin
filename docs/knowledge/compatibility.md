# Compatibility scope

The canonical [compatibility policy](../compatibility.md) covers CLI, reports,
saved plans/ranking/IDs, sessions, defaults, runtime support and package contracts.
Bug fixes can change candidate populations within a patch series; stable scores
are not promised. Breaking supported contracts and expanding defaults require a
minor-version floor increase. Metadata-only release checks retain the current
minor series. [^policy]

# Release decisions

The floor is a minimum, not an exact next tag. The existing allocator chooses
between it and the next stable patch. All five manifests/lockfiles must agree
when the floor changes. Published tags and artifacts remain immutable, and the
TestPyPI/PyPI gates remain in force. [^release]

The PR template records affected interfaces, the version decision and migration.
Generated release notes are not a compatibility validator. Plan/session readers
still enforce their actual schemas and fingerprints; policy text does not add
migration support. [^template][^policy]

# Recheck conditions

Review these rules when changing schemas, ranking, candidate identity, CLI
contracts, defaults, supported environments or package layout. The policy is a
review procedure, not proof of compatibility or retrospective migration.
